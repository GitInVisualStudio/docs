# Installation

## Install with Go (recommended)

To install the latest version of `ksync` (v1.2.1), run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/KYVENetwork/ksync/cmd/ksync@latest
```

To install a previous version, you can specify the version.

```bash
go install github.com/KYVENetwork/ksync/cmd/ksync@v1.0.0
```

Run `ksync version` to verify the installation.

## Install from source

You can also install from source by pulling the ksync repository and switching to the correct version and building
as follows:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KYVENetwork/ksync.git
cd ksync
git checkout tags/vx.x.x -b vx.x.x
make ksync
```

This will build ksync in `/build` directory. Afterwards, you may want to put it into your machine's PATH like
as follows:

```bash
cp build/ksync ~/go/bin/ksync
```
